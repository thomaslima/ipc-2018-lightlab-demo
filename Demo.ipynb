    "\n",
    "In this example, we teach you step-by-step how to connect to an instrument that provides a [TCP/IP socket interface][1]). There are many examples of instruments like that, from providers like Keysight, Tektronix etc. Older instruments won't have the same features but will probably have GPIB, which can be interfaced via TCP/IP via hardware like [Prologix GPIB-Ethernet][2] or [National Instruments GPIB-ENET][3].\n",

    "First, in order to communicate with an instrument, we need what is called a _driver_. Lightlab already has [many drivers][drivers] implemented, but here we will create a new one. This driver will belong to a class of _Source Meters_ ([lightlab.laboratory.instruments.bases.SourceMeter][sourcemeter]), which must implement 9 essential methods: `['startup', 'setCurrent', 'getCurrent', 'measVoltage', 'setProtectionVoltage', 'protectionVoltage', 'setProtectionCurrent', 'protectionCurrent', 'enable']`. Below I have written a basic driver for this demo current source.\n",

    "In the fictitious Demo Current Source manual, you see they provide some commands, like `ENABLE 1/0` to enable or disable the current source, or `CURR 0.2` to set the current to 0.2 amps or `VOLT?` to measure voltage drop across terminals. With this information, you should be able to quickly write a driver below. (This entire demo took me only a couple of hours to prepare)."
