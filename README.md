# ipc-2018-lightlab-demo

As a demo master, update Demo.ipynb with your hostname and run server.py in your computer.

To follow the demo, make sure you have python3.6 or greater installed, then install lightlab and jupyter, launch a jupyter notebook server and finally open `Demo.ipynb`. For those using Mac or Linux, typing `make jupyter` should prepare your environment automatically. (caveat, you need python3 and virtualenv to be in your path).
